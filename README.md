## Overview

This project aims to predict individual medical insurance charges based on various factors such as age, smoking status, sex, region, BMI, and number of children. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the cost of health insurance given these input features.

A live demo of the web application is available (though it may be for local testing purposes): [Insurance Charges Predictor Demo](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
Option 2 (In a Usage Section):



## Usage

To try out the Insurance Charges Predictor locally:

1.  Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (refer to the installation instructions).
2.  Run the application using the command provided in the setup guide.
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

You can then input your details and click "Predict" to get an estimated insurance charge.
Important Considerations for the Link:

Local Link: Keep in mind that http://127.0.0.1:8000 is a local development address. This link will only work for someone who has downloaded your project, set up the environment, and is running the application on their own machine. It won't be accessible to the general public browsing your GitHub repository unless they do all of that.
Deployment: If you intend for others to easily use your predictor without running it locally, you'll need to deploy it to a public hosting platform (like Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, etc.). Once deployed, you would update the link in your README to the public URL.
Clarity: Make it clear in your README that the provided link might be for local testing or development purposes if you haven't deployed it publicly.
